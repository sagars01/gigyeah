# TRADEOFF

Due to time constraints and no hope of success I am going to keep one database and one collection.

application : {
    createdBy: 'id',
    jobId: 'jid',
    applications: [
        {
            name: 'Applicant Name 1",
            shortIntro:  'My name is applicant',
            resumeUrl: 'Some worker from Tier 3 College'
        }
    ]
}
